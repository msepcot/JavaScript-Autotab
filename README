== History

=== Version: 0.2.0

Generic Autotab - Simulate a tab when the user has entered the maximum allowable characters in a form input field.

* Changelog:
** Refactored code to make a generic autotab function that accepts an element and a regular expression formatted string. Attempts autotab if String.Match( RegEx ) succeeds.
** Added keyup_specialKey to check the keyCode value against known special keys, we only want to attempt an autotab if the user makes a change to the form field's value.

=== Version: 0.1.0

Numeric Autotab - Simulate a tab when the user has entered the maximum allowable numeric characters in a form input field.
